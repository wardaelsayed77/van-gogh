            Date : 1889 <br>
            Note: Starry Night is often considered to be Van Gogh's pinnacle achievement. Unlike most of his works,
            Starry Night was painted from memory, and not out in the landscape. The emphasis on interior,
            emotional life is clear in his swirling, tumultuous depiction of the sky - a radical departure from his previous, 
            more naturalistic landscapes. Here, Van Gogh followed a strict principal of structure and composition in which the forms are 
            distributed across the surface of the canvas in an exact order to create balance and tension amidst the swirling torsion of the cypress trees and the night sky.
            The result is a landscape rendered through curves and lines, its seeming chaos subverted by a rigorous formal arrangement.
            Evocative of the spirituality Van Gogh found in nature, Starry Night is famous for advancing the act of painting
            beyond the representation of the physical world.<br>Oil on canvas - Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris</p></div>
