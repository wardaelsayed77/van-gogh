            <p>1889 Van Gogh painted many self-portraits during the course of his career, no fewer than 35.
              The one displayed below, painted in 1889, is one of his most famous.
              Van Gogh depicted himself wearing what he used to work in â€“ 
              his blue jacket and shirt. In an attempt to be as true to himself as possible, 
              he depicts his sharp features, the furrow in his brow, and the striking red tones of his hair and beard.
              This is one of the final self-portraits he painted before his death the following year.</p></div>
